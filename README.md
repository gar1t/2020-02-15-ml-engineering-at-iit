# ML Engineering Workshop at IIT

This is the workshop source code repository for the [ML Engineering
Workshop at IIT](https://chicago.ml/2020/02/15/ml-engineering-at-itt/)
on Feb 15, 20202.

## Slack Channel

If you plan to attend the workshop, please [sign onto the Chicago ML
Slack workspace](http://bit.ly/chicago-ml-slack).

When logged in, join the `#workshop-2020-02-15` channel.

We will use this channel to chat and share links, files, etc. during
the workshop.

## Preparation Checklist

In preparation for the workshop, complete the *Get Started* guide for Guild AI:

[Get Started with Guild AI](https://www-pre.guild.ai/start/)

In addition, confirm that you can step through the following Jupyter
Notebook:

- [https://github.com/guildai/guildai/tree/master/examples/notebooks](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/tree/master/examples/notebooks)

These exercises ensure that your system is properly configured for the
tools we'll be using during the workshop:

- [Guild AI](https://www-pre.guild.ai/) - tool to run and tracking experiments
- [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) - tool to view and compare experiment results
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Python library for building and training models
- [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) - Python library for hyperparameter optimization
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Python library for generating plots
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Python library for data processing and analysis
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - Web based Python evaluation environment

## Exercises

The base exercise for the workshop is the [SVM Iris
Classifier](https://www-pre.guild.ai/start/classifier/) you create in
the preliminary exercises above. This is derrived from the
scikit-learn [SVM
Exercise](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/exercises/plot_iris_exercise.html).

We introduce other exercises during the workshop.

Feel free to explore other [scikit-learn
examples](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html)
for potential workshop ideas.

If you are working on a project, feel free to share your work, if
possible, with the group for a potential exercise.
